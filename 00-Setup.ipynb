    "Note that this tutorial does not replace or circumvent the module documentation - meaning that things are already detailed and explained in the documentation will not be re-explained here. Rather, where the documentation shows you how things work, this tutorial is aimed at giving you a chance to get practice with the module. Alternately stated, we can think of this as something like a _problem set_ for hands-on practice, rather than documentation materials. For detailated explanations, please refer to the documentation.
