# Tutorial

A hands-on tutorial for spectral parameterization and related ideas.

## Overview

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial for learning

It's organized around the following core topics:
- `Setup`: Check that everything is installed & working
- `SpecParamModel`: Introducing spectral parameterization
- `Simulations`: Exploring using simulations to test method properties
- `Applications`: Exploring applications of spectral parameterization
